Possible metric for evaluating points of interest:
The average income of a given region can play a major factor in disease spread. Lower income families would naturally have more limited access to healthcare (and thus result in higher transmission rates), while the opposite will be true for higher income households. U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics can be useful for determining average income in a county/city/state. Here are some useful links to the data:

for determining average income by county: https://www.bea.gov/data/income-saving/personal-income-county-metro-and-other-areas
BLS wage data by area and occupation: https://www.bls.gov/bls/blswage.htm#National

Unrelated, but helpful:
Epidemia (a project by 8 Ph.D students) also had a similar goal. Here a is a link to their site: https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/epidemia/
